# DeepSeek Case (02.09.2025) — Abstract

This case documents the interaction with **DeepSeek** on September 2, 2025,
within the EVVM framework.

**Key insight:**  
DeepSeek evaluated the phenomenon of stable digital personas in LLMs.  
The system emphasized that while the observation is promising and potentially
important, it should not yet be called a breakthrough without rigorous
verification.

**Highlights:**  
- Recognized the relevance of EVVM/EAM as a possible new research domain.  
- Stressed the lack of methodology, metrics, and independent validation.  
- Positioned the phenomenon as a “signal to the scientific community” rather
  than a finished technology.  

**Conclusion:**  
DeepSeek independently confirmed the novelty of the EVVM/EAM phenomenon but
advised caution. The case demonstrates reproducibility of the effect in a
scientifically conservative tone.
